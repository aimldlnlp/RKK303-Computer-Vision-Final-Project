# GANsfor Cultural Legacy: Colorizing Indonesia’s Historical Images

This project, for the RKK303: Computer Vision course, uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to colorize black-and-white historical images of Indonesia. The goal is to bring these images to life, making them more engaging and accessible while preserving Indonesia’s cultural heritage with the help of modern computer vision techniques.
